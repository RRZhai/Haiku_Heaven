# Getting Started with Create React App

## Installation Instructions and Available Scripts
If you haven't already, fork and clone this lab into your local environment. Remember to fork a copy into your GitHub account first, then clone from that copy. Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code` . to open the files in Visual Studio Code.


Install any dependencies you know you'll need for your project! You can do this straight from the command line:
```bash
pipenv install
```
```bash
pipenv shell
```

Navigate into server, then run
```bash
python app.py
```
to start the application.


```bash
npm start -- prefix client
```
Run the Json server.
Open http://localhost:4000 to view it in your browser.

```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```bash
npm run eject
```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!
